#Push Out of Iframes
This framework makes sure that when Google Ads/any ads created inside an iframe, 
the iframes are able to send the contents from within to the outer window.

Things like interstitials, background takeovers or pushdown ads requires the ads 
to be able to be placed on the main window rather than on an iframe. This framework
helps you push the contents out of the iframe to the main window.
